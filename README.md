auto it java integration borrrowed from https://github.com/wangzhengbo/JAutoItX

This java program will send key down and key up events based on microphone audio levels exceeding a threshold. This is useful if a game (eg Counter-Strike Global Offensive) has a push to talk option, but no voice activation. This application will allow you to activate the push to talk key when you start to talk.

With the above example, in Counter-Strike, you could bind push to talk to "k" (bind k "+voicerecord") and it will be activated when the mic level exceeds the configured threshold (30).
