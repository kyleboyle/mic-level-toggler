auto it java integration borrrowed from https://github.com/wangzhengbo/JAutoItX

This java program will send key down and key up events based on microphone audio levels exceeding a threshold. This is useful if a game (eg Counter-Strike Global Offensive) has a push to talk option, but no voice activation. This application will allow you to activate the push to talk key when you start to talk.
